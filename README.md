# Exercises for Genomics

## Scenario A

Jane Doe, a 54 year old female, presented with a lump in her left breast.
Mammogram identified a region of abnormal breast tissue. Histopathological
analysis of a biopsy identified cells with large nuclei to cytoplasmic ratio.
Further immunohistochemical analysis showed that the cells with large nuclei
are estrogen receptor negative, progesterone receptor negative, and
HER2 positive. Sequencing of the remaining sample revealed:

*BRCA2* E1158Q  
13q loss  
*ERBB2* amplification  
chr17:g.7676106del  
chr3:g.179218294G>A  

Note: Coordinates are based on GRCh38.

1. What is the diagnosis? Be as specific as possible and explain the supporting
   evidence.

2. What is the expected 5-year overall survival of this patient based on the
   totality of evidence? Cite your reference.

3. Which targeted therapy may be effective for this patient? Cite your
   reference.

4. What is the original codon at chr17:7676106? What is the amino acid?

5. What amino acid change will result from the chr17:g.7676106del mutation?
   What will be the functional consequences?

6. What is the original codon at chr3:179218294? What is the amino acid?

7. What amino acid change will result from the chr3:g.179218294G>A mutation?
   What will be the functional consequences?

8. Explain how many functional copies of *BRCA2* remain in the sample.


## Scenario B

A ovarian cancer sample (100 mg) was homogenized in 1 mL of TRIZOL reagent in a
1.5 mL tube. After adding 0.2 mL volume of chloroform, the tube was vortexed, 
incubated, and centrifuged at 12,000g for 15 min.
A total of three phases are now visible in the tube.

1. Which phase contains the RNA? Which phase contain protein? Why?

2. How can RNA be extracted from here?

3. Describe the steps after RNA extraction to make a mRNA library for
   sequencing.

mRNA-seq was performed on 20 ovarian cancer samples and 10 non-malignant ovarian
tissue. Differential expression analysis showed the upregulation of
VIM, MMP3, COL1A1, COL1A2, COL3A1, ITGA2, SERPINE1, ACTA2 in the tumour
samples compared to the non-malignant samples.

4. Do the tumours samples show epithelial or mesenchymal phenotype?
   What molecular pathway or biological pathway appeared to be activated 
   in the tumours samples?

5. Immunohistochemical analysis on the tumour and non-malignant samples 
   using antibodies against VIM, SMA, and FAP showed that almost every cell
   that is positive for one marker is also positive for the other markers.
   The number of triple-positive cells is higher in the tumour samples
   compared against the non-malignant samples. What do these results mean?
   Does this analysis change the interpretation of the mRNA-seq data?

6. What follow-up experiments and analyses would you perform?


## Scenario C

A lung adenocarcinoma sample was analyzed by whole genome sequencing.
The following results were obtained:

*BRCA2* N372H, VAF = 0.51  
*TP53* Y220C, VAF = 0.62  
*KRAS* G12C, VAF = 0.43  
*KEAP1* K287*, VAF = 0.29  
iso(17q), clonal  

Spectral karyotyping revealed that the cells are near-diploid, and
no other chromosome abnormality was detected aside from iso(17q).

Variant allele frequency (VAF) is the proportion of alleles in a sample
that has the variant.

Answer the following questions and explain your answers clearly.

1. Which mutations are likely germline?

2. What fraction of the sample likely consists of cancer cells?

3. What fraction of cancer cells have *KEAP1* truncation?

4. What fraction of cancer cells have biallelic loss-of-function in *TP53*?

5. What fraction of cancer cells have both *KEAP1* and *TP53* mutation?
